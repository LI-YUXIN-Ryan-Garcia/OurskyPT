	I think my time  complexity is O(n^2). Because I have two loops in my algorithm, a external loop 
for array2 and an internal loop for array1, time complexity of each loop is O(n) in both the worst case and
the average case, actually, if the length of array1 and array2 are n, m respectively, the time complexity 
will be O(n) * O(m), then the total time complexity is O(n) * O(n).
